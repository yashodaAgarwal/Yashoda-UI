# Yashoda-UI

Yashoda-UI is a continuously developing Component Library, built using HTML5 and CSS3 only. You can use it to build awesome UI layouts.

---

## Installation

Copy and paste the code in the head tag of your html document. So that you can style your components by just adding class names to your html elements.

```html
<link
     rel="stylesheet" 
      href="https://yashoda-component-ui.netlify.app/main.css"                     
      />
```

 Many of Yashoda UI components, like Modal, Toast, and others, require the use of JavaScript to function. For proper functioning of those, Copy-paste the following script near the end of your pages, right before the closing body tag, to enable them.

```html
<script src="https://yashoda-component-ui.netlify.app/js/main.js"></script>
```
